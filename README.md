# Console application for a game of hangman #

This project is a console application made in C#. The base of it is the classic game of hangman, where the player needs to figure out a hidden word by guessing which letters it contains. When enough wrong guesses have been made the player looses.

In this applicaton the player is faced with the option to either guess each individual letter or the whole word. If they are incorrect about the word, they lose.

The words for the game is saved in a .txt file. To add more words to the game, simply add the words to the .txt file, line by line.
